This project focuses on developing a web-based application for detecting brain tumors using deep learning models, specifically the EfficientNet architecture. The platform is built using Django, a powerful web framework for building scalable and maintainable web applications, and incorporates Djangoâ€™s templating system for rendering user interfaces dynamically.
