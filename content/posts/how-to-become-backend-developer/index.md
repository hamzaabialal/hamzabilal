# How to Become a Backend Developer (Practical Roadmap)

Becoming a [Backend Developer](https://hamzabilal.dev) is about mastering the foundations, then building production-grade services. Here’s a focused roadmap based on my real-world work shipping APIs and services.

## 1) Core Foundations

- **Python**: syntax, typing, virtualenv, packaging
- **HTTP & REST**: methods, status codes, auth, pagination
- **Databases**: SQL basics, indexes, joins, transactions
- **Git & Workflows**: branches, PRs, code reviews

## 2) Python Web Frameworks

- **Django + DRF**: ORM, admin, auth, serializers, viewsets, permissions, throttling
- **FastAPI**: async endpoints, Pydantic models, dependency injection, background tasks
- **Flask**: lightweight services, blueprints, simple utilities

## 3) Building APIs That Scale

- **Architecture**: modular services, separation of concerns
- **Testing**: pytest, factories, fixtures, coverage
- **Tasks**: Celery + Redis for background jobs
- **Security**: env secrets, CORS, rate limiting, OAuth flows

## 4) Datastores & Caching

- **PostgreSQL/MySQL**: migrations, transactions, locks
- **Redis**: caching, queues, rate limiters

## 5) Observability & DevOps

- **Logging & Monitoring**: structured logs, alerts
- **Docker**: containerize apps, multi-stage builds
- **CI/CD**: automated tests, deployments

## 6) Portfolio Projects to Build

- Authenticated REST API with Django/DRF (users, roles, tokens)
- Async microservice with FastAPI (webhooks, worker queues)
- Background reporting with Celery/Redis

## 7) Bonus: AI-Driven Backends

If you’re integrating AI: use **AWS Comprehend** for text, deploy custom models on **SageMaker**, and transcribe with **Whisper**. Expose everything cleanly via APIs.

## Final Tips

- Read code, write tests, ship small features often
- Document APIs (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Optimize SQL and profile slow endpoints

Start small, stay consistent, and focus on shipping reliable services. That’s how you become a backend developer companies trust.
