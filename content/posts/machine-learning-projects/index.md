# Machine Learning Projects with Django

Over the past year, I've worked on several machine learning projects that integrate AI capabilities with web applications. Here are some highlights from my work.

## Brain Tumor Detection System

One of my most challenging projects was developing a web-based application for detecting brain tumors using deep learning models, specifically the EfficientNet architecture.

### Key Features:
- Django-based web interface
- EfficientNet deep learning model
- Medical image analysis capabilities
- User-friendly upload and prediction system

The system allows medical professionals to upload brain scan images and receive AI-powered predictions about potential tumors, helping in early detection and diagnosis.

## Climate Change Prediction Platform

I also developed a comprehensive platform that provides climate change predictions for countries around the world for the next 50 years.

### Technical Implementation:
- Django framework for the web application
- JSON data integration from various sources
- Interactive country selection interface
- Data visualization for climate trends

The platform processes large datasets and presents climate projections in an accessible format, helping researchers and policymakers understand long-term climate trends.

## Lessons Learned

Working on these ML projects taught me valuable lessons about:

- Integrating ML models with web frameworks
- Handling large datasets efficiently
- Creating user-friendly interfaces for complex AI systems
- Ensuring model accuracy and reliability

These projects demonstrate the power of combining machine learning with web development to create practical, real-world applications.
