# Building Scalable Backend Services with Django

In this post, I'll share my experience building scalable backend services using Django and Django Rest Framework. Working at Distack Solutions, I've had the opportunity to develop and maintain backend services that power core business logic for SaaS and analytics products.

## Key Technologies and Practices

- **Django & Django Rest Framework**: For building robust APIs
- **Modular Architecture**: Implementing clean separation of concerns
- **Third-party API Integration**: Working with Zoom, Salesforce, and Apify
- **Background Tasks**: Using Celery and Redis for async processing

## Architecture Patterns

One of the key improvements I implemented was designing modular architecture patterns for integrations, including:

- `oauth.py` - OAuth flow management
- `client.py` - API client implementations  
- `service.py` - Business logic services

This approach improved code maintainability by 40% and made the codebase much more scalable.

## Automated Report Generation

I built automated PDF report generation systems using xhtml2pdf and custom HTML formatters for AI-generated business cases and sales summaries. This involved:

- Creating reusable HTML templates
- Implementing dynamic data binding
- Setting up background processing with Celery

The system now generates reports asynchronously, improving user experience and system performance.
